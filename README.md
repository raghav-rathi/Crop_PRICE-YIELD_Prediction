# Crop_PRICE-YIELD_Prediction
In today’s world technology like Machine Learning can help us to predict almost anything. Farmers of our country are always helpful to us in every way and that’s why we’d like to help them with their problem of crop prices. Like, what will be the price of cotton in next season. Some experienced farmers sometimes fail due to unconditional weather and due to acts of GOD. Machine also fails in that situation but M.L. can predict prices upto 80% and with their own experiences they can select which crop to grow. We’re also helping the Government to import or export crops with our Crop Yield Prediction
