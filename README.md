# Crop_PRICE-YIELD_Prediction
In today’s world technology like Machine Learning can help us to predict almost anything. Farmers of our country are always helpful to us in every way and that’s why we’d like to help them with their problem of crop prices. Like, what will be the price of cotton in next season. Some experienced farmers sometimes fail due to unconditional weather and due to acts of GOD. 

Machine also fails in that situation but M.L. can predict prices upto 80% and with their own experiences they can select which crop to grow. We’re also helping the Government to import or export crops with our Crop Yield Prediction

# Machine Learning Model:

- First we’ve collected data of various crops like Cotton, Groundnut, Onion, Wheat, etc.. from
data.gov.in website.
- We are doing price prediction over 9 crops and yield prediction over 30 different crops.
- Then we have made a small Machine Learning Model based on Linear Regression for
checking r2_score of trained data only of cotton for trail and error purpose.
- We almost got 65%.. Then after applying various Regression Tests we’ve finally applies
GradientBoostingRegression and we got 74 to 77% of r2_score.
- Now We are getting minimum of 65 to Maximum of 91 % of Accuracy in some crops.
- Next We decide to use 3 different algorithms to predict crop prices as well as crop yield.
  1. Random Forest Algorithm
  2. Gradient Boost Algorithm
  3. Decision Tree Algorithm
  
# Implementation:

#### The Whole implementation Phase can be divided into four Steps.

  1 Pre-processing and collection of data of crop prices and crop yields
  2 Apply 3 different algorithms on data model.
  3 Prediction with 3 different Algorithms of Crop Prices and Yields.
  4 Farmer can Login/Register to check prices of crops according to seasons.

## Conclusion

- Farmers can easily check prices of Crops according to District, Year, Type,
Seasons.

- Government can easily check Yield Prediction with temperature, area, district and
rainfall data.
